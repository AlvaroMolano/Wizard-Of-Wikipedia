# Wizard-Of-Wikipedia

The Wizard of Wikipedia is an open-domain dialogue task for training agents that can converse knowledgably about open-domain topics. 

The repository contains code for that we used for research purposes and is not the exact implementation of the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.01241.pdf). I will update this soon.
